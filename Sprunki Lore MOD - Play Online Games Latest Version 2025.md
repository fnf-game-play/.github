## The Genesis of Sprunki

Sprunki originated as a fan-made modification of Incredibox, developed by NyankoBfLol on the Scratch platform. This mod introduced new characters and sounds, providing a fresh twist to the original game's mechanics. However, due to content concerns involving gore and blood, it was removed from Scratch.
